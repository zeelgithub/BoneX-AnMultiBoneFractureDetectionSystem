# BoneX - A Multi-Bone Fracture Detection System

BoneX is an AI-powered system designed to detect various types of bone fractures in X-ray images, improving upon previous models that achieved 79% accuracy.

## Features
- Detects seven types of fractures: elbow, finger, forearm, hand, humerus, shoulder, and wrist.
- Provides a clear diagnosis indicating whether an X-ray image shows a fracture or is normal.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this application, you'll need to have [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) installed. Ensure Flask is downloaded and set up before proceeding.

### Running the Application
1. Launch the Flask server.
2. Open the web application in your browser.
3. Upload an X-ray image (JPEG, PNG, or JPG format) showing a potential fracture or a normal bone.
4. Click "Submit" to receive a prediction on whether the image shows a fracture and, if so, the type of fracture detected.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project originates from Stanford University. While not publicly available, access was granted upon request.

## Usage
Simply upload an X-ray image in JPEG, PNG, or JPG format, and the system will analyze it, returning a result indicating whether a fracture is present and, if applicable, identifying the type of fracture.
